- Initially, the wallpaper and color scheme should be decided.

- Basic Terms :

  - Rice: Customised Linux/Unix Desktops
  - Dot Files: Configs of utils used in rice. Dot Files can also be used to replicate rice.

- The participants can use images that match the theme or create their wallpaper matching the theme and color scheme.

- The chosen color schemes could be popular ones like Gruvbox, Nord etc or a color scheme made by you ([reference](http://blog.z3bra.org/2015/06/vomiting-colors.html)).

- The color scheme should be followed in the wallpaper and other components in the rice.
